Thanks for confirming. I will research the best way to deploy a Firebase Function that uses Playwright, ensuring that the required Chromium binary is included and available at runtime. This will include checking proper installation methods, any necessary Firebase configurations, and potential workarounds for common deployment issues.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a solution.

# Deploying a Firebase Cloud Function with Playwright-Chromium

Deploying Playwright (Chromium) on Cloud Functions requires extra steps to include the Chromium browser binary. By default, the Playwright install script may not fully execute in Firebase’s build process, leading to a “Chromium executable missing” error. Below are strategies to ensure the browser is available and the function runs reliably:

## Ensure Chromium is Installed in the Function 
- **Manual Installation During Deploy:** Run the Playwright install CLI to fetch Chromium as part of deployment. For example, add a step to execute `npx playwright install chromium` *before* or *during* deployment. Simply adding a `postinstall` script in package.json often isn’t effective on Cloud Functions (the deploy process may skip or not await it ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=,nothing%27s%20waiting%20for%20it%20AFAICT)) ([Chromium executable doesn't exist for running Playwright within a deployed Google Cloud Function - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171905/chromium-executable-doesnt-exist-for-running-playwright-within-a-deployed-googl#:~:text=,%7D))). Instead, you can use a Firebase **gcp-build** script or a deployment hook to run the install command so that the binary downloads before the function is packaged. This ensures the Chromium executable is present in the deployed code.

- **On-Demand Install at Runtime:** As a fallback workaround, you can trigger the browser download when the function cold-starts. One approach is to call the Playwright installer via a child process at the beginning of your function. For example:  
  ```js
  const { spawnSync } = require('child_process');
  // Inside function code, before launching browser:
  spawnSync('npx', ['playwright', 'install', 'chromium']);
  ```  
  This was shown to fix the missing executable issue ([Chromium executable doesn't exist for running Playwright within a deployed Google Cloud Function - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171905/chromium-executable-doesnt-exist-for-running-playwright-within-a-deployed-googl#:~:text=This%20isn%27t%20ideal%20since%20this,spawnSync%20in%20the%20function%27s%20body)). However, note that this will attempt to install Chromium *on every cold start* ([Chromium executable doesn't exist for running Playwright within a deployed Google Cloud Function - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171905/chromium-executable-doesnt-exist-for-running-playwright-within-a-deployed-googl#:~:text=)), adding latency and consuming bandwidth. It’s a quick fix but not ideal for high-traffic or performance-sensitive functions.

- **Use Environment Variable to Bundle Browser:** Configure Playwright to download browsers into your function’s `node_modules` instead of the default cache. Setting the environment variable `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` (zero) does this ([Running Playwright in GitLab CI](https://til.unessa.net/gitlab/playwright-gitlab-ci/#:~:text=,to%20run%20inside%20GitLab%20CI)). You can set this in your build environment or at the top of your code (before importing Playwright). With this setting, the Playwright install script will place Chromium under `node_modules/playwright` (or `playwright-chromium`), ensuring it gets deployed with your function code ([Running Playwright in GitLab CI](https://til.unessa.net/gitlab/playwright-gitlab-ci/#:~:text=,to%20run%20inside%20GitLab%20CI)). This avoids relying on the home directory cache (`/root/.cache`) which may not persist to the deployed environment. *(In practice, you’d combine this with running the install locally or in a build step so the binary is actually present in node_modules before deployment.)* The Puppeteer team notes a similar approach: caching the browser in `node_modules` helps when Cloud Functions’ build cache might skip the install script on redeploy ([puppeteer/docs/troubleshooting.md at main · puppeteer/puppeteer · GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=Running%20Puppeteer%20on%20Google%20Cloud,Functions)).

## Postinstall Scripts on Firebase Functions  
Firebase Cloud Functions (1st gen) automatically runs `npm install --production` on deployment ([What steps occur when you deploy to firebase functions? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69840837/what-steps-occur-when-you-deploy-to-firebase-functions#:~:text=,using%20the%20npm%20install%20command)). In theory, this should trigger Playwright’s postinstall to download browsers. In practice, it often doesn’t complete. Google’s environment might not wait for the async download to finish ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=,nothing%27s%20waiting%20for%20it%20AFAICT)), or a cached deployment can skip running it altogether ([puppeteer/docs/troubleshooting.md at main · puppeteer/puppeteer · GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=Running%20Puppeteer%20on%20Google%20Cloud,Functions)). 

Important considerations regarding install scripts:
- **Verify Execution:** If you added a `postinstall` in package.json and still see the “Executable doesn’t exist” error, it likely didn’t run to completion (or at all) during deploy ([Chromium executable doesn't exist for running Playwright within a deployed Google Cloud Function - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171905/chromium-executable-doesnt-exist-for-running-playwright-within-a-deployed-googl#:~:text=,%7D)). Cloud Functions will not install devDependencies by default, so ensure Playwright/Playwright-Chromium is listed under `"dependencies"`, not devDependencies, in package.json. Otherwise, it won’t even attempt to install it at deployment time ([What steps occur when you deploy to firebase functions? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69840837/what-steps-occur-when-you-deploy-to-firebase-functions#:~:text=When%20deploying%20to%20firebase%20functions%2C,what%20gets%20run%20during%20deployment)).
- **Use `gcp-build` if needed:** Firebase allows a `"gcp-build"` script that runs after dependencies (including dev deps) are installed ([What steps occur when you deploy to firebase functions? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69840837/what-steps-occur-when-you-deploy-to-firebase-functions#:~:text=,json%20file)). You could put `playwright install chromium` in `gcp-build`. This runs in the build phase with network access. Keep in mind, after `gcp-build` runs, Cloud Functions **prunes and reinstalls** only production deps ([What steps occur when you deploy to firebase functions? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69840837/what-steps-occur-when-you-deploy-to-firebase-functions#:~:text=,json%20file)), so any browser files placed outside the normal dep folders might be wiped. Combining `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` with the gcp-build script can ensure the browser gets downloaded into the `node_modules` where it will remain. Test this process to be sure the binary ends up in the final package.
- **Skip with 2nd Gen Deployments:** If using Cloud Functions (2nd gen, based on Cloud Run), you have the option to deploy via Dockerfile or customize the build. In such cases, it may be easier to install Playwright and run `npx playwright install` in your container build. This bypasses Firebase’s npm install mechanism altogether.

## Increase Memory and Set Runtime Flags  
Headless Chromium is resource-intensive, so adjust your function’s configuration for stability:
- **Memory Allocation:** Give the function more memory – at least 512 MB, and 1 GB or more is recommended for running a headless browser ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=)) ([Deploying Playwright on Google Cloud Functions With Code Examples](https://www.browserless.io/blog/playwright-on-google-cloud#:~:text=Configure%20your%20function%20with%20sufficient,browser%27s%20resource%20demands%20when%20deploying)). Insufficient memory can cause the function to crash or the browser to fail launching. On Firebase (Blaze plan), you can specify memory via `functions.runWith({ memory: "1GB" })` (or higher if needed).
- **Timeout:** Increase the function’s timeout to accommodate browser startup and operations ([Deploying Playwright on Google Cloud Functions With Code Examples](https://www.browserless.io/blog/playwright-on-google-cloud#:~:text=Configure%20your%20function%20with%20sufficient,browser%27s%20resource%20demands%20when%20deploying)). A headless browser may take a couple of seconds to launch. Ensure your function timeout (e.g. 60s or more) is enough for the worst-case scenario (especially if you’re installing the binary at runtime or doing heavy work).
- **Chromium Launch Flags:** Use recommended Chromium flags for serverless environments. Common flags include `--no-sandbox` (if running as root user or if sandboxing is problematic) and `--disable-dev-shm-usage`. For example:  
  ```js
  await playwright.chromium.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage'],
    headless: true
  });
  ```  
  **No-Sandbox:** Cloud Functions’ containers come with necessary libraries for Chrome, so sandbox mode *usually* works, but if you encounter permission errors, disable the sandbox ([Trouble running Puppeteer in Firebase Cloud Functions - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76252839/trouble-running-puppeteer-in-firebase-cloud-functions#:~:text=const%20browser%20%3D%20await%20puppeteer.launch%28,sandbox%22%5D)) ([puppeteer/docs/troubleshooting.md at main · puppeteer/puppeteer · GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=Ensure%20that%20you%27re%20using%20%60%27,sandbox%27%5D)).  
  **Disable /dev/shm:** Functions have a small `/dev/shm`. This flag tells Chrome to avoid using shared memory for IPC, preventing crashes in limited-memory environments ([Running Playwright in GitLab CI](https://til.unessa.net/gitlab/playwright-gitlab-ci/#:~:text=,Launch%20the%20broser%20like%20this)). 

- **Node.js Runtime Version:** Ensure you’re using a Node runtime that Playwright supports (Node 16+). Newer runtimes (like Node 18 or 20) are advisable on Blaze plan for better performance. They also include all the system libraries needed for headless Chrome ([puppeteer/docs/troubleshooting.md at main · puppeteer/puppeteer · GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=Running%20Puppeteer%20on%20Google%20Cloud,Functions)), so you don’t need to install OS packages manually.

## Use a Pre-Packaged Chromium for Serverless  
Another reliable solution is to avoid Playwright’s browser download step entirely by using a packaged headless Chromium specifically designed for cloud functions:
- **Playwright-Core + Headless Chrome Bundle:** Instead of the full `playwright` library, use `playwright-core` (which excludes browsers) and add a dependency like **`@sparticuz/chromium`** (or the older `chrome-aws-lambda`). The Sparticuz Chromium package provides a compressed Chromium binary tailored for AWS/GCP serverless environments ([Deploying Playwright on Google Cloud Functions With Code Examples](https://www.browserless.io/blog/playwright-on-google-cloud#:~:text=Playwright%20typically%20uses%20browser%20binaries,Chromium%20binary%E2%80%94optimised%20for%20serverless%20environments)). By using this, you include the browser binary as part of your deployment (typically ~40–50 MB compressed) which is then decompressed at runtime. This method is proven to work on Firebase/GCP Functions and can be faster than Playwright’s default install process ([@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20Functions)).
- **Launching with a Custom Executable:** When using a custom Chromium binary, launch Playwright with an explicit executable path. For example:  
  ```js
  const chromium = require('@sparticuz/chromium');
  const playwright = require('playwright-core');
  // ...
  const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath(),  // path to the packaged Chrome
    args: chromium.args,  // recommended launch arguments for serverless
    headless: chromium.headless !== false
  });
  ```  
  This ensures Playwright uses the provided Chromium. The code above follows the pattern recommended by the maintainers ([GitHub - Sparticuz/chromium: Chromium (x86-64) for Serverless Platforms](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium#:~:text=const%20test%20%3D%20require%28,core%22%29%3B%20const%20chromium%20%3D%20require%28%22%40sparticuz%2Fchromium)). The `@sparticuz/chromium` package takes care of unpacking the browser to `/tmp` at runtime and provides the needed flags (it’s essentially an updated drop-in for `chrome-aws-lambda`).
- **Advantages:** This approach avoids needing to run `npx playwright install`. The browser is available immediately on cold start (after a quick decompression), and you won’t hit the “missing executable” error. It also keeps your deployment size within limits – the Sparticuz binary is brotli-compressed (~35–50 MB) ([@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda#:~:text=Compression)) ([@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sparticuz/chrome-aws-lambda#:~:text=,0.673s)), which fits in Cloud Functions’ package size constraints. Many in the community have switched to this pattern for reliability ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=Hi%20%40billfeng%2C%20since%20my%20comment,Two%20drawbacks%20with%20that%20approach)) ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=I%27m%20currently%20using%3A)).
- **Version Compatibility:** Make sure the version of `@sparticuz/chromium` (or chrome-aws-lambda) you use matches the Playwright version’s expected Chromium. Mismatches in Chromium version can cause errors. For example, Playwright v1.30 might expect a specific Chromium build – use the equivalent version of the headless Chrome package as noted in its docs ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=Hi%20%40billfeng%2C%20since%20my%20comment,Two%20drawbacks%20with%20that%20approach)). Keeping them in sync is important to avoid protocol or executable incompatibilities.

## Best Practices to Avoid Missing Browser Binary
- **Test Locally and with Emulator:** Before deploying, test your function with the Firebase emulator or locally with the same environment variables. This can catch issues with finding the Chromium binary. For instance, one developer found that setting `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` resolved the “executable not found at /root/.cache/...” error during local emulation ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=Only%20initial%20issue%20was%20that,did%20not%20find%20the%20executable)). Ensuring the path is correct locally will likely translate to a working deployment.
- **Warm Start if Possible:** If your use-case allows, keep the function warm (for example, schedule a ping or use Cloud Functions 2nd gen with minimum instances). This way you pay the install cost (or decompression) less frequently. Cold starts with headless Chrome are expensive; minimizing them improves reliability.
- **Monitor Logs on Deploy:** Watch the deployment logs (`firebase deploy --only functions` output or Cloud Functions build logs) for any hints that the Playwright installation ran or failed. Logs might show if `playwright install` attempted to download Chromium. If it’s not appearing, that confirms you need to force the install via one of the above methods.
- **Community Guidance:** Many have faced this exact issue. The accepted solution on StackOverflow was the runtime install hack ([Chromium executable doesn't exist for running Playwright within a deployed Google Cloud Function - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171905/chromium-executable-doesnt-exist-for-running-playwright-within-a-deployed-googl#:~:text=This%20isn%27t%20ideal%20since%20this,spawnSync%20in%20the%20function%27s%20body)), and the Playwright GitHub issues discuss using `playwright-core` with `chrome-aws-lambda` as a more stable fix ([[BUG] Google Cloud Function error (deploy) · Issue #2321 · microsoft/playwright · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2321#:~:text=Hi%20%40billfeng%2C%20since%20my%20comment,Two%20drawbacks%20with%20that%20approach)). Google’s own documentation for Puppeteer also emphasizes placing the browser in `node_modules` to avoid cache issues ([puppeteer/docs/troubleshooting.md at main · puppeteer/puppeteer · GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=Running%20Puppeteer%20on%20Google%20Cloud,Functions)). In summary, don’t rely on the default Playwright postinstall in Cloud Functions – proactively ensure the Chromium binary gets deployed.

By following these practices – explicitly installing the browser (either at build time or via a packaged binary), adjusting your function’s memory, and using the appropriate launch flags – you can reliably run Playwright-Chromium on Firebase Cloud Functions (Blaze plan). This will prevent the “missing Chromium binary” errors and allow your cloud function to use Playwright for browser automation as intended.
